This repository tracks the latest research, methods, and benchmarks in Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) applied to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) domain.
# 🛰️ Open-Vocabulary Object Detection in the UAV Domain

Welcome to our repository on **Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD)** for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** applications. This is a continuously updated resource that tracks cutting-edge research, benchmarks, and practical insights at the intersection of UAV perception and open-vocabulary detection.

## 📌 Introduction

Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to detect and classify objects **beyond a fixed label set**, making it especially powerful in UAV scenarios where new or rare categories frequently appear.

This repository is dedicated to:

- 📚 Summarizing **recent papers and advances** in OVOD for UAVs
- 🧠 Highlighting **key techniques** (e.g., vision-language models, prompt-based learning, CLIP-based detectors)
- 🛠️ Providing **datasets, code links, and evaluation protocols**
- 📊 Maintaining a **living benchmark** of state-of-the-art methods

## 🔄 Ongoing Work

We will continuously update this repository with:

- 📄 New papers, frameworks, and resources
- 🔬 Experimental results on UAV datasets
- 🧪 Reproducible baselines for community use
- 🤝 Opportunities for collaboration and contribution
